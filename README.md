# Sweep.io
Remake of the windows game "Minesweeper"  
Open the HTML file to start

# Gameplay Mechanics
Left click to open a square  
Right click to place a flag on the square you think there is a bomb

# Rules
The game is intended to have the same gameplay as the original  

The number on a square tells how many bombs there are in adjacent squares  
The objective of the game is finding all the squares that don't have a bomb  
Clicking on a square with a bomb is game over, and you lose  
For now works on a 8x8 grid with max of 10 bombs  

Good luck and have fun!
